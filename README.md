#### Significance

Three stars (or asterisks) represent a highly significant p-value. Consequently, a small p-value for the intercept, vehicle length and ground_clearance indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis.

#### Adjusted R-squared

The R-squared statistic provides a measure of how well the model is fitting the actual data. The R2 we get is 0.6825. Or roughly 68% of the variance found in the response variable (mpg) can be explained by the predictor variables

### Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
Using your knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

Follow the instructions below to complete Part 4.

In your README, create a subheading ## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:

What metric or metrics are you going to test?

What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

What data is needed to run the statistical test?
